This project consists of three Python scripts for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing network packets:

1. `packet_capture.py`: Captures network packets in real-time and saves them to a pcap file.
2. `packet_analysis.py`: Analyzes the captured network packets to extract useful information.
3. `packet_visualization.py`: Visualizes the results of the packet analysis using Matplotlib.


To use the packet analysis and visualization scripts, follow these steps:

1. Usage Ensure that Scapy library is installed (pip install scapy).
2. Run `packet_capture.py` to capture network packets and save them to a pcap file (`captured_packets.pcap`).
3. Once `packet_capture.py` has finished running, you can then run `packet_analysis.py` to analyze the captured packets.
4. Finally, run `packet_visualization.py` to visualize the results of the packet analysis.

Please note that `packet_analysis.py` and `packet_visualization.py` require the pcap file generated by `packet_capture.py` to have data to work with. Make sure to run `packet_capture.py` first before running the other two scripts.



In this script:
•	We utilize Scapy's sniff function to capture network packets in real-time.
•	We count the number of TCP and UDP packets separately, enabling protocol distribution analysis.
•	We compute statistical measures such as mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation for packet lengths, offering insights into packet size distribution.
•	We count occurrences of each TCP flag within the captured TCP packets, facilitating analysis of TCP protocol behavior.
• We visualize the packet counts for TCP and UDP, the distribution of packet lengths, and the occurrences of TCP flags
•	The script features robust error handling to ensure reliability during packet capture and analysis.
•	The script assumes TCP and UDP traffic in the pcap file; however, it can be adjusted to accommodate other types of network traffic as needed.
